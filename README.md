## ‚Åâ What's GoEmergency ?

GoEmergency is a project that aims to help people make better decisions about
what to do when they have certain symptoms, but it in no way replaces the help of a qualified healthcare professional.

It was initially created in 2020 as a course conclusion work on how telemedicine can help 
in a chaotic environment as it was at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.

The system targets clinics in general. Each patient will have personal information registered such as CPF, e-mail, password, etc; being that each one will carry out consultations of diseases of the symptoms that he is feeling, being able to carry out several consultations.
