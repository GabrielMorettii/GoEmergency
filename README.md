## ‚Åâ What's GoEmergency ?

GoEmergency is a project that aims to help people make better decisions about
what to do when they have certain symptoms, but it in no way replaces the help of a qualified healthcare professional.

It was initially created in 2020 as a course conclusion work on how telemedicine can help 
in a chaotic environment as it was at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic.

## Overview

## üèó Class Diagram

The system targets clinics in general. Each patient will have personal information registered such as CPF, e-mail, password, etc; being that each one will carry out consultations of diseases of the symptoms that he is feeling, being able to carry out several consultations. Each doctor will be registered as a person and also with their specialty and CRM. Each patient can open one or more chats with specialist doctors and each doctor can chat with one or more patients.
